# Description

Bind traduction to HTML Element.

# Motivation

## Multiple dictionaries

I wanted to do a blog app. I wanted to get posts using dynamic import. To get traduction through the i18n module, I needed to add json dictionary in addition to the main.

So we can now `registerDictionary(language, url)` and `unregisterDictionary(url)`.
